# ReleaseTracker

#Project Summary

This application allows the user to create a list of upcoming releases they are interested in. It works similar to a calendar, but somewhat different. Let's say I want to buy a DVD that's being released on March 2nd. If I add that event on a calendar, but don't have a chance to buy the DVD until a month later, there's a chance I might forget that it came out. If I add that DVD release to ReleaseTracker, it will stay in my "Newly Released" list until I've bought the DVD and removed it from my list. The application also shows a list of upcoming events that have entered into the application through the "Upcoming Releases" list.

#Running the Program
There are multiple ways to access this program. It can be compiled and ran with any Java IDE, but since I created the project using Eclipse, I will explain how to run the program through Eclipse. Feel free to use any Java IDE you wish.

1. [Download Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/downloads/packages/release/Kepler/SR2) and install it.

2. Download the git repository as a .zip file and extract it to your system.

3. Open Eclipse and select File-\>Import-\>General-\>Existing Projects into WorkSpace. Click Next, then click Browse for root directory and locate your extracted BaseballStatFinder-master. Click Next and then Finish. 

4. Click 'Run' on the toolbar to launch the application.
